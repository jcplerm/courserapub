        "There's a special type of Brazilian steakhouse known as \"Churrascaria\" in Portuguese. They originated in Southern Brazil and provide a unique experience, when compared to other types of restaurants. The main feature is an \"all-you-can-eat\" experience where a variety of meat cuts are brought to the table in skewers. Patrons can control the flow of meat with a red/green token placed on the table.\n",
        " \n",
        "The experience is enhanced with a salad bar (a special for vegetarian patrons...), in addition to other menu items. This makes it possible to entertain large groups with varying degrees of appreciation for a carnivore diet. Brazilian steakhouses also tend to offer a large selection of wines and spirits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the course of the previous 15 or 20 years, a number of chains became well established, in major metropolitan areas and travel destinations in the US. \n",
        "\n",
        "At least one of them, originally from Brazil, was acquired and is now operated by a US-based company. They kept the same brand name and experience. \n",
        "\n",
        "Brazilian steakhouses are certainly not a favourite of all Americans, but based on the opinion of colleagues and acquaitances over the years, it's certainly a favorite  of a large number of individuals and families. This can be verified by the attendance.\n",
        "\n",
        "It seems to me that although the number of Brazilian steakhouses increased across the USA over the years, there's still room for more restaurants. \n",

        "The goal of this study will be to investigate what would be the goegraphical areas in the US that show potential for new restaurants of this type.\n"
